USE
 * Tensorflow, keras
 * Monitor/visualize using tensorboard
 * ReLU
 * Adam
 * Batch normalization
 * Softmax as last layer for classification problems
 * Search for good hyperparameters with random search (not grid search)
 * Ensemble of nets will always increase performance


STARTING POINT
 * Momentum = 0.9
 * Second_momentum = 0.999
 * Learning rate = 1e-3 or 5e-4
